      <description>History This theme began its life in early 2013.
Principles I have always believed in using as little computing resources as possible. This theme uses the excellent purecss css library, which is tiny while still being quite functional.
The colours used have been chosen to be easy on the eyes, with just enough contrast to help with accessibility.
This theme is by no means complete. I have added to it over the last six years and will continue to do so.</description>
